## About

Obfuscript is a powerful tool designed to encrypt C# .NET code for free. It offers a variety of protection methods to ensure your code remains secure while maintaining its integrity. With a user-friendly interface, developers can easily protect their executables and DLLs from unauthorized access and reverse engineering.

Having a license system, we are planning on keeping obfuscript a **freemium application** and soon enough keeping it closed-source. We are going to keep the current source code to attract developers, however, we are not going to offer obfuscript's new code to ensure safety and security for users who have paid for obfuscript's services. We are going to include monthly and yearly plans that cover specific protection methods (only the newly added), while other protection methods will be offered for free. As of now, we are planning to introduce a monthly plan of **$9.99/month** and a yearly plan of **$99.9/year** ___(20.1% less than the monthly plan)___.

## Features

### Protection Methods

- **String Encryption:** Encrypts and replaces all strings.
- **Disguiser:** Renames fields, events, methods, and properties.
- **BloatAndConfuse:** Adds extra scripts and confuses integers.
- **NoDebug:** Stops your file from being debugged.
- **MetaData Killer:** Invalidates MetaData. Also causes dysfunction on some decompilers (e.g. dotPeek. It is unable to any open classes when you've used MetaData Killer)
- **Changer:** Changes strings, integers, etc., into types.
- **Garbage Disposal:** Throws in some garbage to flood the code and properties.
- **dnSpy Killer:** Throws errors in the dnSpy Decompiler, and sometimes may completely crash the application and the user's computer.
- **Control Flow Obfuscation:** Disrupts logical flow by randomizing blocks, adding opaque predicates, and inserting junk code.

### Other
