## About

Obfuscript is a powerful tool designed to encrypt C# .NET code for free. It offers a variety of protection methods to ensure your code remains secure while maintaining its integrity.

- **Disguiser:** Renames fields, events, methods, and properties.
- **BloatAndConfuse:** Adds extra scripts and confuses integers.
- **NoDebug:** Stops your file from being debugged.
- **MetaData Killer:** Invalidates MetaData. Also causes dysfunction on some decompilers (e.g. dotPeek. It is unable to any open classes when you've used MetaData Killer)
- **Changer:** Changes strings, integers, etc., into types.
