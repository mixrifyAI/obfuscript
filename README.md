## About

Obfuscript is a powerful tool designed to encrypt C# .NET code for free. It offers a variety of protection methods to ensure your code remains secure while maintaining its integrity. With a user-friendly interface, developers can easily protect their executables and DLLs from unauthorized access and reverse engineering.

This project has been abandoned.
Reasoning is my dumb*ss forgot to backup the source code, and somehow it just disappeared. I don't know how or when I must have lost it or possibly deleted it without even noticing. It pains me to have to abandon this project, but I cannot begin from scratch again and promise the same performance, results and features.

## Features

### Protection Methods

- **String Encryption:** Encrypts and replaces all strings.
- **Disguiser:** Renames fields, events, methods, and properties.
- **BloatAndConfuse:** Adds extra scripts and confuses integers.
- **NoDebug:** Stops your file from being debugged.
- **MetaData Killer:** Invalidates MetaData. Also causes dysfunction on some decompilers (e.g. dotPeek. It is unable to any open classes when you've used MetaData Killer)
- **Changer:** Changes strings, integers, etc., into types.
- **Garbage Disposal:** Throws in some garbage to flood the code and properties.
- **dnSpy Killer:** Throws errors in the dnSpy Decompiler, and sometimes may completely crash the application and the user's computer.
- **Control Flow Obfuscation:** Disrupts logical flow by randomizing blocks, adding opaque predicates, and inserting junk code.
